# Refuel
I want to make an app where customers can create account and request for fuel refill. We have 4 truck which can go to customer location on demand and refill their vehicle. Customer do not need to go to fuel station. We have different prices for different locations zipcodes. We also need to compare ourself with other local fuel prices and also show this price to customer on app. There will be 2 app. (1) for our drivers who drive the truck to customer location (2) for customer who will request the refuelling. When customer request a refueling, our driver need to accept the request. When accepted customer will be notified. Driver will then go to the customer location and fuel the vehicle and will charge the customer. We always full the tank during fueling. Payment will always be done using Credit cards. All customers must save their credit card on the app. Drivers on their apps can see all bookings. Customer when they try to book a fuel request must select from predefined time slots e.g. 8-11, 11-2 , 2-4, 4-8 , 8-10 We also want to be able to add drivers, customer, zipcode, prices, from bankend. We want to see all bookings, charts, booking per customer, booking per zipcode, etc from backend.
